#| Exercise 2 - Higher-order functions (due Oct 3, noon)

General exercise instructions:
- Exercises must be done *individually*.
- You may not import any Racket libraries, unless explicitly told to.
- You may not use mutation or any iterative constructs (for/*).
- You may write helper functions freely; in fact, you are encouraged
  to do so to keep your code easy to understand.
- Your grade will be determined by our automated testing.
  You can find some sample tests on the course webpage.
- Submit early and often! MarkUs is rather slow when many people
  submit at once. It is your responsibility to make sure your work is
  submitted on time.
- No late submissions will be accepted!

Implement the functions below in Racket without using explicit recursion.
Try using higher-order list functions when you can.
|#
#lang racket

(provide apply-functions function-sort)

#| 
(apply-functions list-of-functions arg)
  list-of-functions: a list of unary functions
  arg: a valid argument to each function in 'list-of-functions'

  Return a list of the results of applying each function in
  'list-of-functions' to 'arg'.

> (apply-functions (list (lambda (x) (+ x x)) (lambda (x) (+ 1 3))) 10)
'(20 4)
|#

(define (apply-functions list-of-functions arg)
  (if (eq? list-of-functions empty)
      '()
      (cons ((first list-of-functions) arg) (apply-functions (rest list-of-functions) arg))
  )
)


#|
(function-sort functions arg)
  functions: a list (f1, f2, ... fn) of unary functions
             which map numbers to numbers
  arg: a number

  Returns a list of the same functions, sorted in increasing order of their 
  output when given 'arg' as input.

  For simplicity, you may assume that the functions in 'functions' will always
  output different numbers when given 'arg'.

> (define fs 
    (function-sort (list (lambda (x) (+ x 3)) 
                         (lambda (x) (- 100 x))
                         (lambda (x) (* x 2)))
                   5))
> ((first fs) 6)   ; (first fs) is (lambda (x) (+ x 3))
9
> ((second fs) 6)  ; (second fs) is (lambda (x) (* x 2))
12
> ((third fs) 6)   ; (third fs) is (lambda (x) (- 100 x))

HINT:
- the built-in "sort" function is a higher-order function, with an optional
  function parameter #:key

(define function-sort (void))
